# Stream Chat Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Stream Chat integration in the GoodTalk application. It covers both the backend token service and channel creation service, as well as the frontend integration.

## Architecture

The Stream Chat integration follows a secure server-side approach:

1. **Backend Services**:
   - Token Generation Service: Securely generates Stream Chat tokens using Clerk authentication
   - Channel Creation Service: Creates channels using server-side admin privileges

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Uses the backend services for token generation and channel creation
   - Handles Stream Chat client initialization and connection
   - Manages channel creation and messaging UI

## Backend Services

### Stream Chat Token Service

The token service is responsible for generating secure Stream Chat tokens for authenticated users.

#### Endpoints

- **POST /stream/token**
  - Generates a Stream Chat token for the authenticated user
  - Requires a valid Clerk JWT token in the Authorization header
  - Returns a token and user ID for Stream Chat connection

#### Security Features

- **JWT Verification**: Verifies Clerk JWT tokens using public keys
- **JWKs Caching**: Caches JWKs to improve performance
- **Error Handling**: Provides specific error messages for different failure scenarios

#### Development Mode

- In development mode (`DEV_MODE=true`), the service can fall back to mock JWT verification
- This is useful for testing but should be disabled in production

### Stream Chat Channel Creation Service

The channel creation service is responsible for creating Stream Chat channels with proper permissions.

#### Endpoints

- **POST /stream/channel**
  - Creates a Stream Chat channel for the authenticated user
  - Requires a valid Clerk JWT token in the Authorization header
  - Accepts `channel_id` and `channel_name` in the request body
  - Returns the created channel details

#### Security Features

- **Server-Side Creation**: Uses server-side admin privileges to create channels
- **User Association**: Associates channels with the authenticated user
- **Error Handling**: Provides specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## Frontend Integration

### Stream Chat Provider

The Stream Chat provider initializes the Stream Chat client and provides context for the application.

#### Key Features

- **Secure Token Fetching**: Fetches tokens from the backend service
- **Server-Side Channel Creation**: Uses the backend service to create channels
- **Error Handling**: Provides fallback mechanisms for error scenarios
- **Cleanup**: Properly disconnects the Stream Chat client on unmount

## Production Considerations

### What to Keep

1. **Token Generation Endpoint** (`/stream/token`):
   - Keep this exactly as is - it's already production-ready
   - The JWT verification is secure and properly implemented

2. **Channel Creation Endpoint** (`/stream/channel`):
   - Keep this endpoint for production
   - Consider adding additional validation or business rules

### What to Change

1. **Remove Development Mode**:
   - Set `DEV_MODE=false` in production environment
   - This will disable the mock JWT verification and test user fallbacks

2. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Add more specific error handling for production scenarios
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring

3. **Consider Rate Limiting**:
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the endpoints
   - This is important for any public-facing API

4. **Add Metrics and Monitoring**:
   - Add metrics for token generation and channel creation
   - Set up alerts for high error rates or unusual activity

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the Stream Chat integration:

#### Backend Service

```
# Stream Chat API Credentials
STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
STREAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret

# Clerk Authentication
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER=https://your-clerk-instance.clerk.accounts.dev
CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key

# Development Mode (set to false in production)
DEV_MODE=false
```

#### Frontend Application

```
# Stream Chat API Key (public)
EXPO_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key

# Clerk Authentication (public key)
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# Backend API URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose the Stream API Secret**:
   - Keep it on the server side only
   - Use environment variables, not hardcoded values

2. **Always verify JWT tokens**:
   - Verify tokens on the server side before generating Stream tokens
   - Use proper JWT verification with issuer and audience checks

3. **Use HTTPS for all API calls**:
   - Ensure all communication between frontend and backend is encrypted
   - Set up proper SSL certificates for production

4. **Implement proper error handling**:
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log errors for debugging but sanitize logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Token Generation Failures**:
   - Check Clerk JWT token validity
   - Verify Stream API credentials
   - Ensure proper environment variables are set

2. **Channel Creation Failures**:
   - Check user permissions in Stream Chat
   - Verify channel ID format and uniqueness
   - Check server logs for specific error messages

3. **Connection Issues**:
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check that the backend service is running
   - Ensure proper environment variables are set

## Future Enhancements

1. **Channel Management**:
   - Add endpoints for updating and deleting channels
   - Implement channel membership management

2. **Message Moderation**:
   - Add server-side message moderation
   - Implement content filtering

3. **Advanced Permissions**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add team and organization-level permissions

4. **Scalability**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed channels
   - Add load balancing for high-traffic scenarios

## Conclusion

The Stream Chat integration follows a secure server-side approach that is production-ready. By keeping the token generation and channel creation on the server side, we ensure proper security and control over the chat functionality.

As the application grows, additional features and security measures can be added to enhance the chat experience while maintaining a secure and scalable architecture.
