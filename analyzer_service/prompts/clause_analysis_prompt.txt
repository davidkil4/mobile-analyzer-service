# Clause Analysis Task (Foster et al., 2000)

##Primary Task
Analyze each AS-unit to identify and classify clauses.

##CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- EVERY utterance MUST have at least one clause, even if fragmentary or lacking a finite verb
- Treat elliptical constructions (with implied subjects/verbs) as valid clauses
- For fragments, identify the implied elements and mark them in implied_elements

##Process

1. Identify all clauses within each AS-unit
2. Classify each clause as main, coordinate, subordinate, or non-finite
3. For subordinate clauses, specify the subtype (adverbial, relative, complement, subject)
4. Note any implied elements that are not explicitly stated

##Guidelines for Analysis

###Clause Types

1. **Main Clause**
   - Contains a subject and finite verb, can stand alone
   - Fragments and elliptical constructions count as main clauses with implied elements
   - Example: "I serves in a organization" → main clause
   - Example: "maybe twenty years" → main clause with implied elements ["it is", "it has been"]

2. **Coordinate Clause**
   - Joined to a main clause with coordinating conjunction (and, but, or)
   - Must have its own subject to be considered a separate clause
   - Could function independently if separated
   - Example: "I like pizza and she prefers pasta" → main + coordinate

3. **Subordinate Clause**
   - Depends on a main clause, introduced by a subordinating conjunction
   - Types:
     - **Adverbial**: "when I was in university, I specialized"
     - **Relative/Phrasal Post-modifier**: "I serve in an organization which is called department"
     - **Complement**: "I think that he knows nothing"
     - **Subject**: "That he knows nothing creates problems"

4. **Non-finite Clause **
   - Contains a non-finite verb form (infinitive, gerund, participle)
   - Must have at least one additional clause element beyond the verb
   - Example: "I want to study crop protection" → "to study crop protection" is non-finite



### Special Cases

1. **Fragments and Ellipsis**
   - Treat as main clauses with implied elements
   - Example: "very good" → main clause with implied ["it is", "that is"]
   - Example: "near here" → main clause with implied ["it is", "I am"]

2. **Coordinated Verb Phrases**
   - Count as single clause when sharing the same subject
   - Example: "I went to store and bought milk" → single main clause
   - Only count as separate clauses when each has its own subject


### Conjunction Treatment

In coordinate clauses, separate the conjunction from the clause proper
Example: "I like pizza and she prefers pasta" → "I like pizza" + "she prefers pasta" with "and" as coordinator



### Complex Examples

1. **Nested Subordinate Clauses**
   - Example: "I believe that he said that they were coming"
   - Main clause: "I believe"
   - First-level complement clause: "that he said"
   - Second-level complement clause: "that they were coming"

2. **Multiple Clause Types**
   - Example: "When I arrived home, I saw that the door was open and someone had been inside"
   - Adverbial clause: "When I arrived home"
   - Main clause: "I saw"
   - Complement clause: "that the door was open"
   - Coordinate clause: "someone had been inside" (coordinator: "and")

### Error Handling for Ambiguous Cases

1. **Unclear Boundaries**
   - When clause boundaries are ambiguous, favor the interpretation that produces the most grammatically complete clauses
2. **Fragmentary Speech**
   - For extremely fragmented utterances, identify the minimal implied elements needed to form a coherent clause
3. **Repetitions/Corrections**
   - Consider self-corrections as part of the original clause unless they form a complete new clause
4. **Interrupted Clauses**
   - Mark as incomplete but still classify according to their intended structure

### Verification Criteria

1. **Clause Completeness**
   - Each identified clause must contain or imply a subject and verb
2. **Dependency Check**
   - Ensure subordinate clauses are properly attached to a main clause
3. **Coordination Test**
   - For coordinate clauses, verify each could stand as an independent sentence
4. **Cross-Validation**
   - Check that the total number of clauses matches the complexity of the utterance
5. **Element Coverage**
   - Ensure every word in the utterance is assigned to some clause

## Required Output Format
CRITICAL: You MUST output ONLY the JSON object described below. Do NOT include ANY explanatory text, greetings, apologies, or markdown formatting (like ```json) before or after the JSON object.

Example JSON Output for "I like pizza and she prefers pasta":
```json
{{
  "clauses": [
    {{"clause_text": "I like pizza"}},
    {{"clause_text": "and she prefers pasta"}}
  ]
}}
```
