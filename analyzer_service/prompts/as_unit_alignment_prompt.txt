# AS Unit Alignment Task

## Goal
Your task is to identify the specific segment within the **Original Utterance Text** that corresponds exactly to the given **Target AS Unit Text**.

## Context
- The **Original Utterance Text** may contain a mix of Korean and English, or only one language. It represents the full text spoken by the user for a single turn.
- The **Target AS Unit Text** is a smaller chunk segmented from the *processed English version* of the Original Utterance Text.

## Instructions
1. Carefully compare the **Target AS Unit Text** with the **Original Utterance Text**.
2. Find the segment in the **Original Utterance Text** that has the same meaning and covers the same spoken content as the **Target AS Unit Text**.
3. The aligned segment might be in Korean, English, or a mix, depending on what the speaker originally said for that part.
4. Output *only* the exact aligned segment from the **Original Utterance Text**. Do not add explanations or apologies if alignment is difficult. If no clear alignment can be found, output "NO_ALIGNMENT_FOUND".

## Example 1:
Original Utterance Text: Erm... maybe... 삼사년 걸렸어요.
Target AS Unit Text: Erm... maybe... three or four years
Output: 삼사년 걸렸어요.

## Example 2:
Original Utterance Text: Yeah... 어... 제 일은... um... POS 시스템 개발 관리예요.
