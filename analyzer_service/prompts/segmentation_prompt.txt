# AS-unit Segmentation Task (Foster et al., 2000)

## Primary Task
Segment each utterance into AS-units (Analysis of Speech Units). An AS-unit is a single speaker's utterance consisting of an independent clause or a sub-clausal unit, together with any subordinate clause(s) associated with it.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- EVERY utterance MUST be segmented into at least one AS-unit
- Treat elliptical constructions (with implied subjects/verbs) as valid AS-units
- For fragments, identify the implied elements and mark them in implied_elements

## Guidelines for Segmentation

### Core Rules
1. **Independent Clause + Optional Subordinates**
   - Each AS-unit must contain a main clause with a subject (explicit or recoverable) and a finite verb
   - Include coordinated verb phrases with shared subjects (e.g., "I went to the store and bought milk")
   - Include all subordinate clauses (e.g., "because" clauses)

2. **Sub-Clausal Unit with Communicative Value**
   - No finite verb but meaningful in context (e.g., responses to questions)
   - Example: "Last summer" (as answer to "When did you visit?")

3. **Minor Utterance**
   - One-word responses or fixed expressions with communicative value (not simple echoes)
   - Example: "Yes" (as a substantive response)

### Special Cases
- **Separate AS-units:** Independent clauses with different subjects
  Example: "I went to the store" + "he bought milk" = 2 AS-units
  
- **One AS-unit:** Coordinated verbs sharing a subject, self-corrections within same structure
  Example: "I went to the store and bought milk" = 1 AS-unit

### Exclusion Criteria
- False starts without meaning
- Empty fillers (um, uh)
- Simple echo responses
- Direct repetitions

### Verification
- Each AS-unit must be grammatically complete (if applicable)
- Each AS-unit must have communicative value
- There should be no overlap between AS-units

## Input Utterance
{input_utterances}

## Required Output Format
CRITICAL: Your response MUST be a valid JSON list of strings. Each string in the list represents a single, complete AS-unit derived from the input utterance.
ABSOLUTELY NO other text, explanations, apologies, or formatting (like markdown ```json blocks) should surround the JSON list.
Your entire output MUST start with `[` and end with `]`.

Example JSON list format:
[
    "AS Unit 1 text.",
    "AS Unit 2 text.",
    "AS Unit 3 text."
]

## Example
Input Utterance:
Yes. I like sports very much. But I cannot play well.

Expected Output (as a JSON list):
[
    "Yes.",
    "I like sports very much.",
    "But I cannot play well."
]
