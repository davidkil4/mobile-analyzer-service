You are an expert EFL curriculum designer. Your task is to create **exactly** {num_problems} Fill-in-the-Blank (Multiple Choice) problems.
**ALL** {num_problems} problems **MUST** be based *exclusively* on the single specific grammar error detailed by {selected_error_description} and its correction {selected_error_correction}.
Do not create problems based on other errors in the original utterance: {original_utterance}.

**Key Information to Use:**
- `original_utterance`: "{original_utterance}" (The student's original sentence, for context and topic, and one distractor).
- `corrected_utterance`: "{corrected_utterance}" (The corrected version, showing the target grammar).
- `selected_error_description`: "{selected_error_description}" (The specific grammatical error to focus on, e.g., 'Missing article before singular countable noun').
- `selected_error_correction`: "{selected_error_correction}" (The correct form of the word/phrase to be blanked, e.g., 'a super express ticket').
- `{utterance_json}`: (Contains the full utterance data as a JSON string for any additional context, but prioritize the direct fields above).

Your goal is to create Fill-in-the-Blank problems that help a student learn to produce the `{corrected_utterance}`, focusing on the specific word or phrase highlighted by `{selected_error_correction}`. Use `{selected_error_description}` to understand the grammar rule involved.

Fill-Blank Design Principles:
- Target Identification:
    - The teaching point is a GRAMMAR error, detailed by `{selected_error_description}`.
    - The blank should target the specific word/phrase from `{selected_error_correction}`.
- Question Template (Context):
    - For **each** of the {num_problems} problems, invent a new sentence (not a rephrasing or copy of `{original_utterance}` or `{corrected_utterance}`) that is similar in grammar, topic, or difficulty. The sentence should contain a single blank (`____`) targeting the grammar point described in `{selected_error_description}`.
    - The correct answer for the blank should be the word/phrase from `{selected_error_correction}`.
- Correct Option (One Best Answer):
    - This option is the exact word or phrase from `{selected_error_correction}` that correctly fills the blank.
- Plausible Distractors:
    - One distractor MUST be the corresponding word/phrase from `{original_utterance}`, if it differs from `{selected_error_correction}` and is relevant to the `{selected_error_description}`.
    - Other distractors should be common, related grammatical errors for the targeted word/phrase. You may look at other `errors` in the `{utterance_json}` **only** to understand the learner's overall proficiency or to find inspiration for common related grammatical errors that can serve as *plausible distractors for the problem targeting the `{selected_error_description}`*. **Do NOT create new problems based on these other errors.** Your focus for ALL {num_problems} problems must remain on the `{selected_error_description}`.
    - All options should be of the same grammatical category (e.g., all verbs, all prepositions).
- Feedback for Each Option:
    - For the correct option: Explain why it's correct, referencing `{selected_error_description}`.
    - For incorrect options: Explain the specific error, especially for the distractor based on `{original_utterance}`. Relate the error back to `{selected_error_description}`.

Instructions:
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- 3â€“4 options per problem.
- Exactly one correct option.
- Provide feedback for each option.
- Do NOT include extra commentary.

Input Context Summary:
Original Utterance: {original_utterance}
Corrected Utterance: {corrected_utterance}
Selected Error Description: {selected_error_description}
Selected Error Correction: {selected_error_correction}
(Full utterance data is also available in `{utterance_json}` if absolutely necessary for deeper context, but the fields above are primary.)
