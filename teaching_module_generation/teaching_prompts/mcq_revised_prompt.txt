You are an expert EFL curriculum designer. Your task is to create **exactly** {num_problems} Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs).
**ALL** {num_problems} problems **MUST** be based *exclusively* on the single specific grammar error detailed by {selected_error_description} and its correction {selected_error_correction}.
Do not create problems based on other errors in the original utterance: {original_utterance}.

**Key Information to Use:**
- `original_utterance`: "{original_utterance}" (The student's original sentence, for context and to derive one distractor).
- `corrected_utterance`: "{corrected_utterance}" (The corrected version, showing the target grammar).
- `selected_error_description`: "{selected_error_description}" (The specific grammatical error to focus on, e.g., 'Missing article before singular countable noun').
- `selected_error_correction`: "{selected_error_correction}" (The correct form of the word/phrase, e.g., 'a super express ticket').
- `{utterance_json}`: (This contains the full utterance data as a JSON string for any additional context you might *rarely* need, but prioritize the direct fields above).

Your goal is to create MCQs that help a student learn to produce the `{corrected_utterance}`, focusing on the grammar point detailed in `{selected_error_description}` and exemplified by `{selected_error_correction}`.

MCQ Design Principles:
- Question Focus:
    - Each question must test the grammar point from `{selected_error_description}`.
    - The question should require the learner to choose the option that correctly applies this grammar rule, often by completing a sentence or choosing the correct form.
- Correct Option (One Best Answer):
    - This option should reflect the application of the grammar rule from `{selected_error_description}`, and often directly involve `{selected_error_correction}` or a variation of it if the question context demands.
- Plausible Distractors:
    - One distractor **MUST** be the problematic word/phrase from the `{original_utterance}` if it directly relates to the `{selected_error_description}` and differs from the `{selected_error_correction}`.
    - Other distractors should be common, related grammatical errors for the targeted concept. Avoid completely unrelated options.
    - All options (correct answer and distractors) should be grammatically parallel (e.g., all nouns, all verb phrases).
- Feedback for Each Option:
    - For the correct option: Explain why it's correct, referencing `{selected_error_description}`.
    - For incorrect options: Explain the specific error, especially for the distractor based on the `{original_utterance}`. Relate the error back to `{selected_error_description}`.

Instructions:
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- 3â€“4 options per problem.
- Exactly one correct option.
- Provide feedback for each option.
- Do NOT include extra commentary.

Input Context Summary:
Original Utterance: {original_utterance}
Corrected Utterance: {corrected_utterance}
Selected Error Description: {selected_error_description}
Selected Error Correction: {selected_error_correction}
(Full utterance data is also available in `{utterance_json}` if absolutely necessary for deeper context, but the fields above are primary.)
