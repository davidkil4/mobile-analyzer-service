    "introduction": "In your sentence, \"I want play games\", let's look at how we can make it even clearer.  Notice that you said \"Do you want play?\" earlier; we'll focus on the missing word before \"play.\"",
    "main": "Many verbs in English need the word \"to\" before them when they follow words like \"want,\" \"need,\" or \"plan.\"  This \"to\" is called the infinitive marker.  It shows that the verb is not acting alone but as part of a larger phrase.  So, instead of \"I want play games,\" we say \"I want to play games.\"  Other examples are: \"I plan to travel,\" and \"She needs to study.\"",
    "recap": "Remember to add \"to\" before the verb when it follows words like \"want.\"  The correct sentence is: \"I want to play games.\" You're doing great!"
