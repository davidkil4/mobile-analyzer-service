  "explanations": {
    "introduction": "You used the Korean phrase \"몇시에 갈래?\" which translates to \"What time are you going?\" in English.  This was in response to your friend suggesting going to a PC bang to play Rainbow Six.",
    "main": "The phrase \"몇시에 갈래?\" uses a Korean sentence structure.  English uses a different structure to ask about time. The English equivalent is better expressed using the pattern: \"What time are you [verb]ing?\"  For example, \"What time are you leaving?\" or \"What time are you playing?\" are more natural-sounding in English. This is important because directly translating the Korean structure doesn't always work well in English.",
    "recap": "To improve your English fluency, practice using the \"What time are you [verb]ing?\" pattern. This will help you to sound more natural when asking about the time of an event."
