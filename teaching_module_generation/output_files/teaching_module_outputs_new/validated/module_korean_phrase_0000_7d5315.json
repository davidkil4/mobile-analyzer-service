    "introduction": "You used the Korean phrase \"아무것도 안 해\", which translates to \"I haven't been doing anything.\" in English.  Your friend asked, \"How about you?\" after you heard \"How are you doing?\" and \"I'm doing good.\"",
    "main": "The error lies in directly translating the Korean phrasing into English.  While \"아무것도 안 해\" is grammatically correct Korean, English uses a different structure to describe inactivity over a period.  The correct pattern is \"I haven't been doing [activity]\" or \"I haven't been doing anything.\"  This emphasizes the ongoing nature of the inactivity. For example:  \"I haven't been doing much exercise lately.\" or \"I haven't been doing anything fun this week.\"",
    "recap": "Practice using the English pattern \"I haven't been doing [activity]\" to express a lack of activity. This will help you sound more natural in English conversations."
