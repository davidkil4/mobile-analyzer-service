    "introduction": "In your sentence, \"Do you want to go to pc방?\", let's focus on using articles correctly.  Notice that you're asking about going to a specific type of place.",
    "main": "In English, we use indefinite articles (\"a\" or \"an\") before singular, countable nouns when we're not referring to a specific one.  \"PC bang\" is a singular, countable noun, meaning one place.  Adding \"a\" makes it clear you're talking about going to *a* PC bang, not a specific one.  For example, \"I visited a museum yesterday\" or \"She wants to open a coffee shop.\"  Your corrected sentence uses \"a\" correctly.",
    "recap": "Remember to use \"a\" before singular, countable nouns like \"PC bang\" when you aren't referring to a specific one.  The correct sentence is: \"Do you want to go to a PC bang?\"  You're doing great!"
